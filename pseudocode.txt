	
	The program "tempConverter" creates a temperature table with two columns 
showing a celsius to fahrenheit and a fahrenheit to celsius conversion.
Both tables start at value 20.0 and display the corresponding conversion to 
the right hand side. The temperature value starts at 20.0 and increases from
one row to the other by a variable magnitude which is entered by the user, the program stops printing conversions when the temperatures reach the value 280.0 as requested and specified in the original proposal. 
This is the only variable link in the program. The main functionality of the 
program can be described by the following pseudo code.

Logic program execution:

INITIALIZE CONSTANTS:
LOW_VALUE_TEMP
HIGH_VALUE_TEMP
...
	//Prompt for user’s imput
	PRINT: Enter a single digit from 1 to 9:

	//Validate the user’s input 
	EXECUTE: validate_user_imput(){

			GET: The user’s input.

			IF:(user’s imput is not valid)
				EXECUTE: validate_user_imput()
			ELSE
				imput is valid digit from 1 to 9
				CONTINUE.
		}
	//Print the table using the official conversion formulas
	EXECUTE: print_table_data() {
		INITIALIZE
			meter = LOW_VALUE_TEMP

		REPEAT
			PRINT (meter + JUMP, fahrenheit_to_celcius(meter))
			PRINT (meter + JUMP, celsius_to_fahrenheit(meter))
			INCREMENT meter BY 1
		WHILE 
			meter <= HIGH_VALUE_TEMP
	}
	END
